I want to have the relationship between key combination and unicode escape chaaracters but i didnt' find this... 

The only related thing I found was   https://github.com/chjj/blessed/blob/master/lib/keys.js that seems to be adapted from http://www.midnight-commander.org/browser/lib/tty/key.c

but is backwards relationship, is escape char -> key

so this project is about playing with that to build the opposite relationship, probably by reverse ingeneer
